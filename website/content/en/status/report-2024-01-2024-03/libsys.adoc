=== libsys

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

The libsys project removes direct system calls from `libc.so` and
`libpthread.so` (aka `libthr.so`) to a separate `libsys.so`.
This will:

 * Isolate language runtimes from the details of system call implementations.
 * Better support logging and replay frameworks for systems calls.
 * Support elimination of the ability to make system calls outside trusted code in the runtime linker and `libsys`.

This work was initially inspired by a compartmentalization prototype in CheriBSD in 2016.
Ali Mashtizadeh and Tal Garfinkel picked that work up and attempted to upstream it (link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D14609[D14609]).
Unfortunately we couldn't figure out how to review and land the massive reorganization required through a phabricator review so it languished.
Last year the CHERI project once again found a need for system call separation in a new library-based compartmentalization framework in CheriBSD so I rebuilt the patch from scratch, committing dozens of libc cleanups along the way.
I landed the first batch of changes on February 5th.
Since then I've made a number of refinements to the way we link libsys as well as which symbols are provided in which library.

Thanks to Konstantin Belousov <kib@FreeBSD.org> for many rounds of review and feedback as well as runtime linker fixes.
Thanks to Mark Johnston <markj@FreeBSD.org> for runtime linker debugging and Dimitry Andric <dim@FreeBSD.org> for sanitizer fixes.  
Thanks also to everyone how reported bugs and helped debug issues.

==== Known issues (as of the end of the reporting period)

 * The `libsys` ABI is not yet considered stable (it's safe to assume `__sys_foo()` will be supported so language runtimes can use it now).
 * Programs using the address sanitizer must be linked with `-lsys` (resolved in base at publication time).

==== TODO

 * Add a `libsys.h`.  (See link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D44387[D44387] and other reviews in the stack.)
 * Update man:intro[2] for `libsys`.
 * Finalize the ABI.  I'm likely to reduce the set of `_` (underscore) prefixed symbols we expose.
 * MFC the existence of `libsys`?  It's not clear this is practical, but it might be possible to MFC something useful for language runtimes.

==== Help wanted

 * Port language runtimes that don't use `libc` to use `libsys` for system calls rather than rolling their own interfaces.
 * Explore limitations on where system calls can be made similar to OpenBSD's link:https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-7.3/msyscall[msyscall(2)] (now obsolete) and link:https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls[pinsyscalls(2)] (not an obvious match to our libsys).
